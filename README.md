# DICNet: Dual-path Imbalanced Feature Compensation Network for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification

## Highlight
We propose a novel DICNet to alleviate the modality imbalance in VI-ReID. Unlike conventional feature compensation methods, we reallocate modality features to simulate modality imbalance scenarios, enhancing identity discrimination ability.
